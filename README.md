# Crypto-App

## About

This is going to be a multi page REACT JS application, using the CoinGecko API. The entire project will be styled with Tailwind CSS. In this app, there will be a lot of cool features such as using Context for the Light/Dark Theme, using Routes from React-Router-Dom to navigate to different pages. Also I will be using axios, in order to connect to the CoinGecko API and make API calls. Furthermore, there will be a Firebase backend, with which I am going to be able to authenticate new users, sign up new users then sign in with that user and store user specific data and finally sign out. One of the coolest features, I would say, would be that a person could save the coin they like into something like a watchlist, in order to keep track of that specific coin and check if the state of the price has changed.

## Development

The website is crafted using cutting-edge technologies, blending React, Firebase, and Tailwind to deliver an immersive experience. Explore a myriad of features, including Light/Dark Mode, Authentication, dynamic routes, and the seamless navigation provided by React-Router-Dom. Harness the power of useContext for state management across the entire application. Dive into the world of advanced functionalities, such as a robust filtering and sorting system, a comprehensive search mechanism, and a fully functional checkout form.
